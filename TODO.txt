Move values for model/submodel IRI/IRDIs to a separate lookup/config.

Look into removing all redundant strings from code body into lookups that only
 evaluate during serialization.

Implement full ContactInformation SMC.

Implement constraints

Add schema validation to submodel elements.

Clarification needed on where an EventPayload fits into the model.

Clarification needed on how 'isCaseOf' fits into an SMC.

Clarification on IRDI identification. how to retrieve?

Complete ContactInformations submodel.

Do something about ModelReference<Referable> data type missing from the model and
 being simply Reference.

Add EmbeddedDataSpecification implementation. needed for serialization.

After implementing all XSD data types, modify ValueDataType to be an xs type/class
 instead of js 'any'

Add a serilize method to serilize all appropriate classes

Check to see if there are any plans to include other nameplate SMCs (markings etc.)

Investigate possible scaling issues with promise.all() in controller.
